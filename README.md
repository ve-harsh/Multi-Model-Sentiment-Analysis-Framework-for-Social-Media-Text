# ðŸš¨ Sentiment Analysis of Tweets for Hate Speech Detection

This project aims to classify tweets based on whether they contain hate speech, specifically racist or sexist content. It is framed as a binary classification task.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
Given a dataset of tweets labeled as either hateful (1) or not hateful (0), the objective is to build models that can accurately identify racist or sexist tweets from normal ones.

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
Tweets are preprocessed by:

Removing special characters, URLs, stopwords

Tokenization and lemmatization

Lowercasing and normalization

âœ¨ Feature Extraction
To convert the textual data into numerical features, we use:

ðŸ§± Bag of Words (BoW)

ðŸ“Š TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

ðŸ§  Word2Vec Embeddings

Each representation captures different aspects of the language used in tweets.

ðŸ¤– Model Building
We train Logistic Regression models using each of the three feature sets:

BoW + Logistic Regression

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Word2Vec + Logistic Regression

All models are built using Scikit-learn and Gensim.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is measured using:

âœ… F1 Score

ðŸ“‰ Accuracy

ðŸ§® ROC-AUC Score
