# ðŸš¨ Sentiment Analysis of Tweets for Hate Speech Detection

This project aims to classify tweets based on whether they contain **hate speech**, specifically **racist** or **sexist** content. It is framed as a **binary classification task**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Given a dataset of tweets labeled as either hateful (`1`) or not hateful (`0`), the objective is to build models that can accurately identify **racist or sexist tweets** from neutral ones.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Tweets are cleaned and normalized using the following steps:

- ðŸ”¹ Removal of special characters, URLs, and stopwords  
- ðŸ”¹ Tokenization and lemmatization  
- ðŸ”¹ Conversion to lowercase and general text normalization

---

## âœ¨ Feature Extraction

To convert the textual data into numerical features, we use three different techniques:

- ðŸ§± **Bag of Words (BoW)**
- ðŸ“Š **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- ðŸ§  **Word2Vec Embeddings**

Each representation captures different aspects of the tweetâ€™s structure and meaning.

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Building

We train **Logistic Regression models** on each of the feature sets mentioned above:

- ðŸ”¹ `BoW + Logistic Regression`  
- ðŸ”¹ `TF-IDF + Logistic Regression`  
- ðŸ”¹ `Word2Vec + Logistic Regression`

All models are implemented using **Scikit-learn** and **Gensim** libraries.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using the following metrics:

- âœ… **F1 Score**
- ðŸ“‰ **Accuracy**
- ðŸ§® **ROC-AUC Score**
